*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Describe your work and results clearly. 
- Assume the reader has an introductory course level understanding of writing and reading R code as well as statistical methods
- Assume the reader has no previous knowledge of your data or the more advanced methods you are using  

__Reading the data in to R__  
First set the working directory to the IODS folder and then read in the local tab separated copy 

```{r}
setwd("~/Work/IODS-project")
analysis2014 <- read.table("data/analysis2014.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
```

__The structure and the dimensions of the data__  
```{r}
str(analysis2014)
dim(analysis2014)
```
The data has 166 rows and 7 columns. The columns show the age, gender, attitude and points of the 166 students.  
In addition the data frame has three combined scores for deep learning, structured learning and strategic learning.
